# content_extractor

I used spacy to extract an imperfect but useful content list for my 100 level courses in maths/computer science

Note:

1. I didn't extract these lists manually; I used python code
2. It is obviously imperfect, but I'm too lazy to do anything about that right nowðŸ˜Œ

NB: The actual github script is in the .gitignore, because I will assume you aren't a programmer...
